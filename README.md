## **Prevention and Responsibility in OSINT Usage**

Within the framework of this OSINT project, we emphasize the critical importance of using tools and information with morality in accordance with prevailing laws. OSINT, while powerful for gathering information from open sources, poses significant risks if not practiced with discernment. It is everyone's responsibility to respect the laws on privacy, copyright, and data protection. Before using or sharing information obtained through OSINT, ask yourself the following questions:

- **Do I have the right to access and share this information?**
- **Could my use of this data potentially harm individuals or organizations?**
- **How can I ensure that my actions adhere to moral principles and legal standards?**

We urge all users of this project to exercise caution, adhere to moral standards in accordance with the laws, and operate within the legal framework. The goal is to promote a culture of responsibility and integrity within the OSINT community, ensuring that tools and information are used in a way that supports openness, transparency, and respect for individuals.

**Remember: Access to information does not grant the right to compromise someone else's privacy. Always act with responsibility and discernment.**
